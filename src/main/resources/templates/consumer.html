    <p>Why European households seem so wasteful? It might appear as a broad and tricky question. Fortunately, several studies have been published trying to unpack the household food waste reality:

      Food stored (3) at a temperature that is too low or too high is subjected to a degradation in quality faster than normal.
      Food that is bought for a specific occasion or a special recipe is likely to sit in a shady corner of the cabinet for months or years (4). The “shady corner” phenomenon is then exacerbated by poor shopping planning, a bad habit that often results in buying something that is already present in our fridge or cabinet.
      Packaging, which should protect the food and increase the shelf life, is often found to be a driver of food waste. It is the case of multi-packs and fixed portion sizes, which can lead to over-buying and, consequently, wasting (5). Too large packaging and packaging difficult to empty are other reasons for perfectly edible food being thrown away (6).
      Wrong interpretation of the meaning of “best before” and “use by” is notably a cause of food waste in household and it is also cited in the Farm to Fork strategy as one of top issues to address (7).
      The aesthetic requirements that push us not to pick the apple with a bruise from supermarket shelves are likely to play a role in the domestic environment as well (8).
      If there is something that researchers will never be tired of repeating, is that changes in behaviour are not easy to achieve. Luckily enough, a number of notable initiatives, both from the public and private sectors, have joined the fight against food waste, with the goal of generating awareness and nudging behavioural change in consumers.

      WRAP, a charity from the UK, promoted an information campaign called Love Food Hate Waste, aimed to spread the knowledge about practical everyday things to waste less food. Through the creation of a webpage displaying optimal storage information, local radio adverts, local online advertising, and cooking clubs the campaign was able to achieve a 14% decrease in avoidable food waste in West London.

      Too Good To Go, a social-impact company fighting food waste,  is not only working to save food at the retail level. The company is also creating a whole movement around food waste and it aims to inspire 50 million people to change their behaviour. How? One of the main initiatives is the date labelling campaign, which seeks to clarify the difference between “best before”, which is related to food quality, and “use by”, which is related to food safety.  Too Good To Go has engaged with food companies to change the “best before” in “best before, but often good after”. In this way, consumers can feel safer to eat food that has passed its “best before” date and can be reminded of the difference with the “use by” every time they check the label (you can read Zero Waste Europe’s case study here).

      Grim, a Copenhagen-based company, delivers subscription boxes full of ugly fruit and vegetables usually not accepted by supermarkets because of the stringent aesthetic standards. The impact that Grim is likely to have is not only related to the actual food saved. Consumers that buy an “ugly box” might be pushed not to discard an imperfectly shaped cucumber the next time they go for grocery shopping.

      Phenix, a French start-up, has saved about 60 million meals in 5 years by organizing redistribution flows for unsold food. One of the Phenix’s initiatives is the creation of the ‘Gueules Cassées’ label, a sticker that retailers can use to signal the presence of discounted food. The discount is often due to a short expiry date or aesthetical defects. The consumers are then encouraged to purchase the food that is “as good but cheaper” (you can read Zero Waste Europe’s case study here).

      These are just a few examples of entities that engaged in the fight against food waste and that are contributing to European goals with their work. Yet, a lot of work needs to be done and a lot of it needs to be done at the policy level. To be effective, waste reduction policies should bear in mind the importance of understanding consumers behaviours and patterns to be able to change them. Moreover, an excessive tendency to blaming the consumers might result in an over simplistic way of dealing with the food waste issue. Food waste is a complex issue and needs to be treated as such. Interventions are needed from Farm to Fork, seeking for interconnections between the different levels and understanding that none of them can be “waste-free” without looking at the big picture.</p>
